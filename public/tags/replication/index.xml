      <description>AbstractIn a fourthcoming paper by members of the Open Science Collaboration, we outline how one could use quantitative estimates of “replication value” to guide study selection in replication research. We define replication value conceptually as a ratio of “impact” over “corroboration”, and we show how to derive quantifiable estimates from this definition. Here I will try to identify a reasonable and quantitative operationalization of corroboration. I first propose to approximate corroboration through the more narrow concept “precision of the estimate” (figure 1).</description>

      <description>Justifications of study choice from 85 replication studies.In their recent BBS article, Zwaan et al. (2017) synthesized arguments for and against replication research and laid out a convincing argument for the value of direct replication in science. My collaborators and I wrote a commentary on this article (Coles et al. 2018). In it, we argued that in order to maximize the utility of replication in a science that is operating under resource constraints (there is only so much time and money for doing research), we need to deal with the question of when to replicate.</description>
