      <description>Everything is awesome. Everything is cool when you’re part of a team. The idea of having heaps of scientists come together to accomplish something none of them could do on their own is not new. Take CERN, established in 1954 and one of the most famous large scale collaborations in science to date. CERN is a massive experimental undertaking with a mission to address fundamental problems in physics. Today, it employs over 2500 scientists from 22 countries and has lead to some pretty impressive innovations, like the construction of the Large Hadron Collider (the world’s biggest machine), the discovery of the Higgs boson, and the invention of the Word Wide Web.</description>
