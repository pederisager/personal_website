      <description>(This is a reposting of a blog post originally posted to: https://metaresearch.nl/blog/2019/12/16/meta-research-at-the-psychological-science-accelerator)
Friday November 22, 2019, the Meta-research center at Tilburg University (https://metaresearch.nl/) organized the meta-research day. Around 90 researchers attended the meta-research day that involved three plenary lectures, by John Ioannidis (who received an honorary doctorate from Tilburg University a day earlier), Ana Marušić, and Sarah de Rijcke, and seven parallel sessions on meta-research (https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/about/schools/socialsciences/organization/departments/methodology-statistics/colloquia/meta-research-day). One of these sessions was titled How can meta-research improve the Psychological Science Accelerator (PSA) and how can the PSA improve meta-research?</description>
