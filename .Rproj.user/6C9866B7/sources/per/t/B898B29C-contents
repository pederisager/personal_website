# Biography

I am a PhD student studying research practices in psychology at Eindhoven University of Technology. I am currently working with Daniël Lakens and Anne Scheel on the project "Increasing the Reliability and Efficiency of Psychological Science". So far I have worked on topics such as equivalence testing and replication value. I am also a board member on the Data Management committee at the Psychological Science Accelerator. 

Before moving to the Netherlands I did a BA and an MPhil at the Univerity of Oslo, Norway. For my BA I conducted an experiment on social status perception. I then moved into cognitive neuroscience and spent my MPhil doing research on the rewarding properties of opioid administration in healthy humans. I also spent a summer at the University of Linköping, conducting an experiment on human emotional communication via touch.
